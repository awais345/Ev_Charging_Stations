# Electric Vehicle Charging Sessions Analysis

This repository contains the dataset gathered from the field experiment [A Field Experiment on Workplace Norms and Electric Vehicle Charging Etiquette](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/NFPQLW) by Professor Omar Asensio from School of public policy, Georgia Tech uniersity. The dataset consists of information from 3395 high-resolution electric vehicle charging sessions. These sessions were recorded as part of a workplace charging program, involving 85 EV drivers, 105 stations, and 25 sites. The workplace locations encompass various facilities, including research and innovation centers, manufacturing sites, testing facilities, and office headquarters.

# Dataset
The dataset 'station_data_dataverse' is provided in a .CSV format. It contains anonymized data, ensuring the privacy of the individuals and organizations involved. Each charging session record includes details such as charging duration, energy consumption, charging cost, station ID, site information, and driver information.

# Analysis Methodology
The analysis of the dataset is performed using Python and various data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, seaborn and Matplotlib.

# Analysis Steps
The Jupyter Notebook file, EV_Chraging_stations.ipynb, contains the step-by-step process of analyzing this dataset. The notebook provides detailed explanations of each analysis step, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and generating visualizations.
